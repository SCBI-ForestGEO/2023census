# Forest Census  

Smithsonianâ€™s National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute (NZCBI) is seeking six individuals to work on a team conducting the 2023 census of the [Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO) plot at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute](https://forestgeo.si.edu/sites/north-america/smithsonian-conservation-biology-institute) outside of Front Royal, VA.
The crew will include a lead technician and five interns, to be mentored by plot principal investigators [Dr. William McShea](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/about/staff/william-j-mcshea) & [Dr. Kristina Anderson-Teixeira](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/about/staff/kristina-j-anderson-teixeira). 
The team will inventory all woody plants within a large (25.6 ha) forest dynamics plot, gaining skills in forest ecology and scientific data management.
The lead technician should have experience with forest census and ability to coordinate and lead field research.
Internships are ideal for recent college graduates who wish to gain research experience prior to pursuing graduate studies or other forest-related career opportunities.
The census will begin in spring (prep work starting in March, interns starting in April or May) and continue into the fall (positions ending between September and November). 
Detailed ads and application instructions are posted on GitHub (crew lead: https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/2023census/blob/main/doc/positions/crew_lead.md; interns: https://github.com/SCBI-ForestGEO/2023census/blob/main/doc/positions/internships.md) and will be updated with answers to applicant questions.
Review will begin November 14 (crew lead) or November 21 (interns).
We are committed to diversity in science, and especially welcome applications from women and minoritized groups.
